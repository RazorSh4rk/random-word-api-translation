# A script to provide translations for the [random-word-api](https://github.com/RazorSh4rk/random-word-api)

Take a look at `run.sh` on how to build this, it was written for arch but can be run 
on any OS.

After you are done, fork the main repo, put the $LANG.json into the languages folder and make a pull request.
Make sure that you don't change the json file name from the official language code.
